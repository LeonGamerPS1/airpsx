### AirPSX
AirPSX is a payload similar to AirDroid; It allows you to manage many operations related to your console via the web-based desktop environment.

> [!WARNING]
> I AM NOT RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR CONSOLE IF SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG!
>
> I do not accept any responsible for misuse of the file manager, execution of malicious scripts, or any damage that may occur to the console in any case.

## Run

### elfldr
- Run elfldr payload
- Linux
  - socat -t 99999999 - TCP:PS5_HOST:9021 < "airpsx.elf"

### etaHEN
- Run etaHEN payload.
- Connect FTP (Common Ports: 1337, 2121)
- Locate airpsx.plugin to "**/data/etaHEN/plugins**"
- Open Debug Settings -> etaHEN Toolbox -> Plugins
- Enable airpsx.plugin
- Optionally you can enable "airpsx.plugin" as startup item 

### websrv
- I do not recommend this method, because AirPSX closes after the browser is closed.

## Build

- Run install.sh
- Locate the project folder and execute the following command:
```sh
export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/opt/ps5-payload-sdk && haxe release.hxml --cmd "mv out/HxWell out/airpsx.elf"
```

## Dependencies
- [hxcpp fork](https://github.com/barisyild/hxcpp/tree/ps5-payload)
- [hxwell](https://github.com/barisyild/hxwell)
- [rulescript](https://github.com/Kriptel/RuleScript)

    - If it wasn't for [intellij-haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/intellij-haxe), maybe I would never have write any haxe project :(

## How it works
This web project is built using my web framework, [hxwell](https://github.com/barisyild/hxwell). Leveraging the power of Haxe, all source code is transpiled to C++ and compiled using the PS5 Payload SDK.
